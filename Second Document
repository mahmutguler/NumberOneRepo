Hello Word!
In this second file, line wrap mode was selected as Soft wrap option.

After creating the second file, I was checking the documet and saw that there is view options such as Raw and Blamde style. 
Raw style is the show the document with a whtie backgorund to hide all distraction. But the other one more elaborate than the normal view.
And I am going to commit this file edits as a branch to the main repo.
